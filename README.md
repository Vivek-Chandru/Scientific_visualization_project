# Scientifc Visualization Task: Image processing

## Problem statement:
Take the file wood-2.bmp in the stud.ip folder and create new bmp  files for i) red content, ii) blue content, iii) green content, iv) converted to grey scale. Apply a laplace filter to the file with grey scale, store the result in a bmp file. Rings should now be  visible which represent the growth in each year. Write a code which counts the rings in two  different directions (from the center of the piece of wood). Submit the bmp files as well as the program code and a documentation of the result (how is  the result obtained?)

## Code Functions:
 - Applies red / blue / green / Grayscale filters to the supplied image by modifying RGB values of the image
 - Applies Lapalcian and gaussian filters to highlight dark features in the image (ex. dark rings in the cut wood section)
 - Counts the number of wood rings while mitigating any error sources
>** Note: ** A detailed explanation of the code functions and solution strategy is given in the document **Project_1.pdf**
